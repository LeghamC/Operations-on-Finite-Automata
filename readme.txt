The way we represent the transitions is different from the one in the project sheet.
To indicate transitions it should be in the following format:
current_state input_symbol next_state1 next_state2 ... next_stateN
BUT the following format also works:
current_state input_symbol next_state1
current_state input_symbol next_state2
That is separating the transitions in different lines also works.
