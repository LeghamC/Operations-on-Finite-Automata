# Operations-on-Finite-Automata
Project of Finite Automata and Regular Expressions, P2-S4


## Introduction 



## Usage

This program allows you to load a finite automaton from an existing file and perform various operations in it.

### Selecting your automaton
At the beginning, you will be asked to enter the number of an automaton (between 1 and 44) or choose to exit. If you decide to continue, the wanted automaton wil be displayed so you can have a look at it before choosing the operation you want to perform.

### Choosing on Operation
Once you choosed your automaton, you can perform one of the following operations: 
  1. Standardization
  2. Determinization and completion
  3. Minimization
  4. Word recognition
  5. Complementary language
You can either enter the number corresponding to th operation you want to perform or return to the maine menu at any time

## Features
### Standardization
This function standardizes a non-standard funtcion and display it. If the automaton is already in standard form, the program will inform the user
